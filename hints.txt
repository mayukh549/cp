if there are multuiple possible way to bring ans then try to reduce the multiple numbers into one or 2 variables eg(I hate 111)

if there is a operation told try to bring a conclution from it that that actually is the opeartion doing 

n/(lcm(a,b,c...) ===> number of terms that are divisible by a,b,c..... out of first n terms 

even odd thought 

XOR thought

modulo thought 

see the series 

series that has sum of 2 numbers or fibo nacci series is like a series of 2 4 8 16 32 64 ....

the product of any n consecutive number is always divisible by n! 

precompute 2*10^5;


binary search when cannot understand anything use it or when some thing like the max value needs to be calcuated


use the const in the problem like sum of array const ,product of 2 elements const gcd cond lcm const .


left iteration right iteration ...

adjacent 2 odd numbers are coprime

next_permutation ------- prev_permutation

check % and / sign
