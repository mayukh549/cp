if there are multuiple possible way to bring ans then try to reduce the multiple numbers into one or 2 variables eg(I hate 111)

if there is a operation told try to bring a conclution from it that that actually is the opeartion doing 

n/(lcm(a,b,c...) ===> number of terms that are divisible by a,b,c..... out of first n terms 

even odd thought 

XOR thought

modulo thought 

see the series 

series that has sum of 2 numbers or fibo nacci series is like a series of 2 4 8 16 32 64 ....

the product of any n consecutive number is always divisible by n! 

precompute 2*10^5;


binary search when cannot understand anything use it or when some thing like the max value needs to be calcuated


use the const in the problem like the sum of array const , product of 2 elements const gcd cond lcm const.


left iteration right iteration ...

adjacent 2 odd numbers are coprime

next_permutation ------- prev_permutation

check % and / sign 

minimize one term and check the next terms

sort one array and take all possible sum of other arrays using the next permutation until n!

base 9 representation of the digit for missing digits

always try to check the sum of 2the broken parts by a formula example Split and ADD (cc)

in reversing the question of the query check the final answer and also check if common parts can be removed by +1 -1 concept or binary search on bits 

when the power questions are given try n=1 and n>=2 as in n=1 sometimes median gives the best possible ans and n>=2 average gives the best possible ans
when 3 parameters are given think in terms of parameters eg project starting date ending date

minimum maximum taking out trick in query question break the entire array in pawers of 2 then it will we easy to ans the question  

when ever taking remainder if ithas some increment thing carefully (eg C. Jellyfish and Green Apple);

deriving the final answer from the question (bit break individually independently ) 
dp[x][y]=min(dp[x][k]+dp[k+1][y])+ar[x]*ar[k+1]*ar[y+1]; k for all x-->y+1

inclusion exclusion principle

if  i compute all multiples of a number it takes nlog(n) time 

form aljebric equation in the then analyse the problem if bit doesnot work 

(E. Data Structures) Fan nice concept to be known 

use boundary condition like putting x =1 div 2  1st problem 
in dp problem or ay other problem always see the boundary condtion can be positive as well as negative as assigned -1 initially 

dp finaal state (helpfull for multi dimentional dp) , from middle (grid dp) ,from beginning (help full for array 2 d dp);
use arrangement of l,R to solve number of waysto rech a partical position ;
and if 1->k steps are possible then use bottom up dp(it iterative dp)
break from a part and solve it independently then  combine them (f(i,j)=f(i,k)+f(k+1,j)+some combining term ) in dp

 try brute force untill a certain point approach (see from where th etherms are repeating)

when breaking a number in array  and adding it in 2 parts in the array check all the parts of the number (mistake in B. Milena and Admirer)

range question always when inside a raneg it sgould be in the 2 parts (eg D. Jumping Through Segments)


 sum of digits if same the  (range is btwn 0 9) so no carry possible

minimum bar korar jonno sorting is not the best possible always eg pinlley round 3 question 2
what does the question operation in the greedy question actually want to say do not think about how it is written find the inner simple meaning 
take the ans as x then find the mathematical expression example pinley round 3  q 4

in the math questiosn always give a thought on taking consecutive lcms and then moving forward or taking consecutive gcd and moc=ving forward or taking gcd or lcm of differences and then moving forward 

find the ans or find the contribution of each element in the ans (C. Sequence Pair Weight)
distinct ans are only possible 
break expression into functions and find the best possible value of earch part thr draw a inequality between the part to connect the funtion example 
think precomutaton and use a nearest known property and try to modify the opration given in question using aljebra
